The main process spawns a renderer process to do all the rendering.  The
renderer renders a triangle to a VkImage like a regular Vulkan app, with two
exceptions.

The color of the triangle is supplied to Vulkan using a UBO, whose underlying
memory is a memfd.  Then vkCopyImageToBuffer is used to copy the triangle from
the VkImage to a VkBuffer, whose underlying memory is also a memfd.

The main process updates the triangle color and reads the frame data through the
memfd.
